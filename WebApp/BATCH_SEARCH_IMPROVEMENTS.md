# Batch Search Improvements

## Overview
Significantly improved the batch search (Multi-Item Search) flow with better status indicators, state persistence, and seamless integration with the quotation system.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Simplified Table View

**Before:**
- Status column showing "Match Found" or "Unmatched"
- Ordering number hidden in expandable section
- Unclear what action needed

**After:**
- **Ordering Number column** showing actual status:
  - ✅ `CYL-450-X` - Green, bold (ordering number chosen)
  - ⚠️ `− Not yet chosen` - Orange, italic (matches available, needs selection)
  - ❌ `✗ No matches found` - Red, italic (needs manual entry)

**Table Structure:**
```
| + | Item # | Product Type | Requested Item | Quantity | Ordering Number |
|---|--------|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| + |   1    | Valve        | High pressure  |    2     | SS-10-2345      |
| + |   2    | Cylinder     | Standard 50mm  |    5     | − Not yet chosen|
|   |   3    | Tube         | Heavy duty 25mm|   10     | ✗ No matches found |
```

### 2. Visual Row Status Indicators

**Color-coded rows:**
- 🟢 **Green background** (`#F0FDF4`) - Item has ordering number selected
- 🟡 **Yellow background** (`#FFFBEB`) - Item has matches but not yet chosen
- 🔴 **Red background** (`#FEF2F2`) - Item has no matches, needs manual entry

### 3. Allow Incomplete Items in Quotation

**Before:**
- Required all items to have ordering numbers before saving
- Blocked workflow if matches weren't found

**After:**
- ✅ Can save to quotation with incomplete items
- Confirmation dialog shows: "You have X item(s) without ordering numbers. You can complete them later from the quotation. Continue?"
- Incomplete items marked with `isIncomplete: true`
- Notes field shows: "Needs ordering number - return to batch search"

### 4. State Persistence & Round-Trip

**Session Storage:**
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('batchSearchState', JSON.stringify({
  uploadedFileName: 'products.xlsx',
  items: [...], // All item states preserved
  timestamp: '2024-10-27T...'
}));
```

**What's Preserved:**
- Uploaded file name
- All items with their match selections
- Expanded/collapsed states
- Selected matches

**Restoration Flow:**
1. Save to quotation from batch search
2. Work on quotation (add prices, etc.)
3. Click "Return to Batch Search" button
4. Batch search page automatically restores:
   - Shows banner: "Continuing previous batch search • products.xlsx"
   - All items exactly as you left them
   - Can complete remaining items

### 5. Return to Batch Search Button

**In EditQuotation:**
- Only visible when:
  - Quotation came from batch search (`batchSearchAvailable: true`)
  - There are incomplete items (`incompleteCount > 0`)
- Orange button with arrow icon
- Shows count: "Return to Batch Search (3 incomplete)"
- Positioned in controls bar next to "Pull Prices"

### 6. Improved Progress Indicator

**Before:** "Items Processed Correctly"
**After:** "Items have ordering numbers"

Example: `8/12 Items have ordering numbers (67% Complete)`

More accurate representation of what needs to be done.

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Scenario 1: All Items Found
```
1. Upload Excel file
2. Expand items, select matches
3. All rows turn green
4. "Save to Quotation" → 12/12 complete
5. Add prices in quotation
6. Finalize and export
```

### Scenario 2: Some Items Not Found
```
1. Upload Excel file (12 items)
2. Select matches for available items (8 items)
3. 4 items show "✗ No matches found" (red rows)
4. Click "Save to Quotation"
5. Dialog: "You have 4 item(s) without ordering numbers..."
6. Confirm → Navigate to quotation
7. Quotation shows 4 incomplete items with note
8. Add prices for 8 complete items
9. Click "Return to Batch Search (4 incomplete)"
10. Back to batch search - exact state preserved
11. Banner shows: "Continuing previous batch search"
12. Manually enter ordering numbers for 4 items
13. Save to quotation again (updates existing)
```

### Scenario 3: Partial Selection
```
1. Upload Excel file
2. Select matches for some items only
3. Yellow rows: "− Not yet chosen"
4. Can save to quotation with partial completion
5. Return later to complete selection
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Status Color System
| State | Background | Text Color | Font Style | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Complete** | Light Green | Dark Green | Bold, Monospace | Ordering number selected |
| **Pending** | Light Yellow | Orange | Italic | Has matches, need selection |
| **No Matches** | Light Red | Red | Italic | Manual entry required |

### Banner Design
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🕐  Continuing previous batch search • products.xlsx  ✕ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Yellow/amber color scheme
- Clock icon
- Dismissible (X button)
- Shows file name

### Return Button Design
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ← Return to Batch Search (3 incomplete)    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Orange/amber color (#F59E0B)
- Left arrow icon
- Shows incomplete count
- Prominent but not primary action
