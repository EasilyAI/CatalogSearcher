## üîÑ Key Integration Points

### 1. Unified Mock Data
- **Single source**: All components use `/src/data/mockQuotations.js`
- **Consistent data**: Same quotations appear in Dashboard, Quotations list, and Add to Quotation dialog

### 2. Navigation with State
All navigation passes relevant data via `state`:

```javascript
// From Single Search
navigate('/quotations/edit/new', { 
  state: { 
    items: [quotationItem],
    customer: 'New Customer',
    source: 'single-search'
  } 
});

// From Multi-Item Search
navigate('/quotations/edit/new', { 
  state: { 
    items: quotationItems,
    customer: 'New Customer',
    source: 'batch-search'
  } 
});

// Adding to existing quotation
navigate(`/quotations/edit/${quotationId}`, { 
  state: { 
    newItem: quotationItem,
    source: 'single-search'
  } 
});
```

### 3. Breadcrumb Navigation
Every page shows contextual breadcrumbs:
- Links are clickable for easy navigation
- Current page is highlighted
- Source information shown when coming from search

### 4. Flow Indicators
- **Breadcrumbs**: Show current position in workflow
- **Progress bars**: In Multi-Item Search show completion percentage
- **Status badges**: On Dashboard show work-in-progress quotations
- **Source tags**: In Edit Quotation show where items came from

## üé® Visual Indicators

### Dashboard
- üü° Yellow highlight for quotations with incomplete items
- üìù "Continue ‚Üí" button for in-progress work
- üìä Item count and incomplete count visible

### Search Pages
- üìç Breadcrumbs at top
- üîÑ Next step preview (grayed out in breadcrumbs)
- üìà Confidence scores with visual bars

### Edit Quotation
- üè∑Ô∏è Source badge showing origin (single-search / batch-search)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete badge with count
- üîç "Search" button for incomplete items
- üíæ Unsaved changes indicator

## üìä Mock Data Structure

  status: 'searching items',
  itemCount: 5,
  totalValue: 1025.00,
  incompleteItems: 2,
  createdDate: '2024-01-20',
  lastModified: '2024-10-27'
}
```

### Quotation Items (in EditQuotation)

  orderNo: 1,
  orderingNumber: 'SS-109-12345',
  requestedItem: 'High pressure NPT valve',
  productName: 'Advanced Industrial Motor',
  productType: 'Valve',
