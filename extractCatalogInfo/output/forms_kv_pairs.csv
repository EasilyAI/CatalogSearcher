2,Features,"Body made of seamless tubing provides consistent wall thickness, size, and capacity. Smooth internal neck transition allows easy cleaning and eliminates trapped fluids. Cold-formed female NPT threads provide greater strength. Heavy-wall end connections provide strength and resist flaring. Swagelok® DOT sample cylinders conform to 49 CFR Part 178, ""Specifications for Packagings."""
2,Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive (TPED / UK TPE),"The Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive (TPED / UK TPE) provides requirements relating to the design, manufacture, and testing of transportable pressure vessels and accessories, including sample cylinders and rupture discs. The intent of the directive is to provide a uniform level of product safety throughout the European Union countries and the United Kingdom. For information about TPED / UK TPE-compliant Swagelok products, see the Swagelok Products Compliant with the MS-02-193."
